a Siri like terminal app based in node.js. This app takes a few different inputs and returns info about what the user searched. 

The inputs: 

spotify-this-song song name : This uses Spotify's Node package to search by song title and returns the artist, song title, album, and a link to the song on Spotify. 

movie-this movie title : This uses the OMDB API to search a movie titles. The search returns title, year, production country, language, actors, ratings, and a plot summary. 

my-tweets : This uses Twitter's Node package to display my most recent tweet. Feel free to try it out to test functionality but the tweets that are there now will most likely be the tweets that will always be there.
